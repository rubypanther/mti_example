== Welcome to mti_example

This is an example app showing how to use PostgreSQL's MTI (Multiple Table Inheritance) feature within a rails ap. This should also work as an example if you are using ActiveRecord outside of rails.

== Why use MTI?

The two reasons to use MTI are mixin tables and legacy databases. Mixin tables allow you to add columns selectively to a subset of your child tables. In the example, we mixin columns for authlogic to a Member model.

== How?

The main technique here is to use a :type column and let AR think that standard STI is being used.

Also, child tables need a carefully constructed migration.

This example uses three tables and two models. There is a base table users, a child table members with an extra column for a self-referencial belongs_to, and mixin table authlogic_fields.

The intention of the example is just enough that you can play with it in irb. It is not a complete example, and I did not add views or any of that.

Where there is:
* db/migrations/*
* app/models/user.rb
* app/models/member.rb

== TODO

If you know of a better to set the primary key than to use the ALTER TABLE statement in the members migration, please let me know. It would be ideal to have just the one create_table call.

== BUGS

If you use the parent model directly, the objects will get the correct child class but will only have the columns in the parent. Calling #reload will load the missing fields.
